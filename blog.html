   <h2>Want to pick up rust</h2>
   <p>Date:- 2024/11/04 time: 12:30 am</p>
   <p>Why do i need to know this abstraction? Why do I need to work with graphics?</p>
   <p>All I know that rust is great, that's what I have heard! Memeory safe and what not. It really dosen't seem to unlock a lot, it a lot similar to what C already unlocked</p>
   <p>It dosn't really unlock any new knowledge base, its just a tool after all. I still don't know why I should learn Rust</p>
   <p>And computer graphics? I hate video games. Why else should I bother? Does it have anything to do with science? Does it have anything to do with nature?</p>
   <p>Or will it give me wicked skills to deal with science or nature?</p>
   <p>I don't really know </p>
   <p>But still lets move forward</p>
   <p>My aproach would be to just answer on question at a time!</p>
   <p>My brain has to pick one question first</p>
   <p>Lets draw a simple yellow rectange</p>
   <p>I need some window to display it</p>
   <p>so I have to create the window</p>
   <p>Even windows is a graphical concept</p>
   <p>So a lot of it is given to me</p>
   <p> I need to know the lower level details though! (why) I don't care about the end result, I want to know. </p>
